I love creating physical objects directly from Python code. This tip makes it really easy and immediate. If you use the default desktop arrangement for FreeCAD you find yourself flipping between the part view and the code view, which is a bit of a pain. So, what you do is this:

 Make sure that you have the code that deletes old elements on each run (see the FreeCAD tip [here](/pages/Clear%20your%20workspace.md).

Select **Windows>Tile** from the main menu. 

Move your views of the code and the CAD workspace so that you can see them both comfortably. 

Now, when you run the code you will see your design update right in front of you. No need to open a different window. 

This works even if you have zoomed into a particular part of the view.
