# Macro File Location

![Macro dialogue in FreeCAD](/images/macros/Macro%20Dialog.png)

By default (unless you specify otherwise) macros will be stored in your **roaming profile** folder which should mean that if you use the same login on a different machine, your macros will be there too. However, if you want to store them somewhere else you can use the **User macros location:** selector at the bottom of the Execute Macro dialog to select an alternative location. When you're editing a macro file you can save it in a different folder if you wish.

You can also use the FreeCAD **File->Save As** menu item to save a macro file anywhere you like on your machine. It will be saved with the extension FCMacro.
